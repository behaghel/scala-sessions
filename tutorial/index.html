      <h2>Session 0: Warm Up</h2>
      <p>You'll find solutions to the problem we were working on in
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/PrimeNumbers.scala">
          src/main/scala/PrimeNumbers.scala
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>The first object <code>Euler3</code> solves
        the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=3">third problem
          on Project Euler</a> but requires a function that takes an
        integer and return a sequence of all the prime numbers up to
        that number. We will use that to see various approaches to
        building this function.</p>

      <p>The most ancient algorithm to build such function is
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve
          of Eratosthene</a>. I have been asked at the end of last
        session to provide a functional implementation of it. Let's
        study that.</p>
      <p>Have a look at the 3 different approaches in
        the <code>Eratosthene</code> object.
        <ul>
          <li>The first one <code>primesImperative</code>, I would expect to
            be close in essence to what you would call a good old imperative
            implementation.</li>
          <li>Then we have <code>primesMRS</code> with MRS standing
            for <i>Map Reduce Style</i>. Here we have given up on
            performance utterly at least in a mono-thread processing.
            Still, it's functional and it's worth knowing as it's
            highly parallelisable. We shall review that once we know
            how to do it.</li>
          <li>Last but not least <code>primesSPS</code> for <i>State
            Passing Style</i>. Another to name would probably
            be <i>the recursive solution</i>. But first, functional
            programmers aren't that big of fans of recursivity. That
            may surprises you but yeah, FP coders know better. And
            soon you will too! Second, that doesn't convey the key
            move of this technique. You'd better learn right now
            that state encapsulation is no panacea.
      </ul></p>
      
      <p>Now have a look at my approach with <code>object
          Hubert</code>. Simple, elegant and yes, fast[1]. That gives us
        Eratosthenes — 0, Euler — 0, Hubert — 1. Now tell me why I am
        the one who doesn't have a dedicated Wikipedia page.</p>

      <p>Check this out
        in <a href="#code/src/test/scala/PrimeNumbersBenchmark.scala">PrimeNumbersBenchmark.scala</a>.
        It
        uses <a href="http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.7/index.html">scalameter</a>.
        I discovered it while preparing this session. Since some of us
        want to pay a particular attention to performance, having it
        handy is a very good idea. Performance on the JVM is hard to
        measure. To learn more on how scalameter helps and the caveats
        of JVM microbenchmarking, read through its documentation.</p>

        <p>In this benchmark, you'll see first a series of run of each
        version of the sieve of Eratosthenes. Each series starts from 30
        up to 1000 with a step of 75.</p>

        <p>Then you'll see how each performs on Euler problem #3 but with
        a significantly smaller number. Finally we are benchmarking my
        solution on the real number from problem #3.</p>

      <button data-exec="test-only session0.PrimeNumbersBenchmark">See
        for yourself</button> (click then head over the <i>Build</i> tab
      on the left panel, section <strong>Develop</strong>)

      <p>If you have a lot of time or your room is a bit cold and you
        fancy some CPU-powered heat, you can try the other methods
        in <code>Eratosthenes</code> on the real number. More
        interesting, try with your own solution.</p>


      <p>[1] Well on my machine it's ~18 seconds. But that's the thing
        with prime decomposition right? It's hard and slow, that's why
        cryptography loves it. Now ask Eratosthenes to solve it,
        millenaries is probably an overstatement but you'll definitively
        look older and not necessarily wiser.<p>

      <h2>Session 1: Meet My Dad</h2>
      <p>Since you've watched Martin's video on Coursera (week 2),
      let's have a go at
      the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-002/assignment/view?assignment_id=4">related
      assignment</a>. Shamelessly, I have copy pasted the
      code <a href="#code/src/main/scala/RecFun.scala">here</a> and
      the statement below. To test your solution, I have also
      boostrapped
      a <a href="#code/src/test/scala/RecFunSpec.scala">Spec class</a>
      for you.</p>

      <h3 id="exercise_1_pascals_triangle">Exercise 1: Pascal’s Triangle</h3>

      <p>The following pattern of numbers is called <em>Pascal’s
      triangle</em>.</p>

<pre><code>   1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
   ...</code></pre>

      <p>The numbers at the edge of the triangle are
      all <code>1</code>, and each number inside the triangle is the
      sum of the two numbers above it. Write a function that computes
      the elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive
      process.</p>

      <p>Do this exercise by implementing the <code>pascal</code>
      function
      in <code><a href="#code/src/main/scala/RecFun.scala">RecFun.scala</a></code>,
      which takes a column <code>c</code> and a row <code>r</code>,
      counting from <code>0</code> and returns the number at that spot
      in the triangle. For
      example, <code>pascal(0,2)=1</code>, <code>pascal(1,2)=2</code>
      and <code>pascal(1,3)=3</code>.</p>

      <pre><code>def pascal(c: Int, r: Int): Int</code></pre>

      <h3 id="exercise_2_parentheses_balancing">Exercise 2: Parentheses Balancing</h3>

      <p>Write a recursive function which verifies the balancing of
      parentheses in a string, which we represent as
      a <code>List[Char]</code> not a <code>String</code>. For
      example, the function should return <code>true</code> for the
      following strings:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>(if (zero? x) max (/ 1 x))</li>

        <li>I told him (that it’s not (yet) done). (But he wasn’t listening)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The function should return <code>false</code> for the following strings: </p><ul>
        <li>:-)</li>
        <li>())(</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <p>The last example shows that it’s not enough to verify that a
      string contains the same number of opening and closing
      parentheses.</p>

      <p>Do this exercise by implementing the <code>balance</code>
      function
      in <code><a href="#code/src/main/scala/RecFun.scala">RecFun.scala</a></code>.
      Its signature is as follows:</p>

      <pre><code>def balance(chars: List[Char]): Boolean</code></pre>

      <p>There are three methods on <code>List[Char]</code> that are
      useful for this exercise:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>chars.isEmpty: Boolean</code> returns whether a list is empty</li>
        <li><code>chars.head: Char</code> returns the first element of the list</li>
        <li><code>chars.tail: List[Char]</code> returns the list without the first element</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Hint</strong>: you can define an inner function if
      you need to pass extra parameters to your function.</p>

      <p><strong>Testing</strong>: You can use the <code>toList</code>
      method to convert from a <code>String</code> to
      a <code>List[Char]</code>: e.g. <code>"(just an)
      example".toList</code>.</p>

      <h3 id="exercise_3_counting_change">Exercise 3: Counting Change</h3>

      <p>Write a recursive function that counts how many different
      ways you can make change for an amount, given a list of coin
      denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for
      4 if you have coins with denomiation 1 and 2: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2,
      2+2.</p>

      <p>Do this exercise by implementing the <code>countChange</code>
        function
        in <code><a href="#code/src/main/scala/RecFun.scala">RecFun.scala</a></code>.
        This function takes an amount to change, and a list of unique
        denominations for the coins. Its signature is as follows:</p>

      <pre><code>def countChange(money: Int, coins: List[Int]): Int</code></pre>

      <p>Once again, you can make use of
      functions <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>head</code>
      and <code>tail</code> on the list of
      integers <code>coins</code>.</p>

      <p><strong>Hint</strong>: Think of the degenerate cases. How
      many ways can you give change for 0 CHF? How many ways can you
      give change for &gt;0 CHF, if you have no coins?</p>

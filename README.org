* Motivation

This is a set of exercises and code material for learning Scala. 

* Getting Started

This project uses the [[https://typesafe.com/get-started][Typesafe Activator]] (~brew install activator~ on
OS X). Once you have it:
- clone
- ~cd scala-sessions~
- ~activator ui~
- Open the tutorial and become a better coder.
  

* Contributing

Only PRs that fix something wrong will be accepted. If you want to
suggest a new solution, share it using Gist or something similar.

If you want a particular aspect of Scala to be covered, feel free to
file an issue.

* Maintainer
